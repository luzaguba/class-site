  <p>Messy stations slow things down.
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.
I'll make this easy to remember.
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?
Always return to this position.
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.
